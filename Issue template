##Issue Template##
Thank you for helping us identify issues with our Demo DApp.  We appreciate your help.

Please follow this checklist for ways to clearly lay out any issues that you find
- First check that issue does not exist already
- Please name your issue
- Determine priority (based on impact)
- Understand which repo to use, what label to tag issue with
- Platform used (OS version, browser version)
- Any detail that can help developer reproduce/troubleshoot is helpful: screenshot, short video, and any messages that show up in the browser console. More detail is always appreciated.

If you need help or have any questions, please ask in our #qa-testing channel on Discord. Thank you.
